Growth in aviation contributes more to global warming than is generally
appreciated because of the mix of climate pollutants it generates:
aviation contributed 5.3% to observed human-induced global warming since 1990,
despite being responsible for only 2.4% of global annual emissions of CO2.
Aviation is on track to have caused a total of 0.1˚C of warming by 2050,
despite a reduction due to COVID-19, should the pre-COVID growth resume.
But the leveraging impact of growth also represents an opportunity: under
the existing fuel mix, aviation’s contribution to further warming would be
immediately halted by either a sustained annual 2% decrease in flights or
a transition to a 90% carbon-neutral fuel mix by 2050.
