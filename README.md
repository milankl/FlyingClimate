**Growth in aviation contributes more to global warming than is generally
appreciated because of the mix of climate pollutants it generates: aviation
contributed approximately 4% to observed human-induced global warming to date,
despite being responsible for only 2.4% of global annual emissions of CO2.
Aviation is projected to have caused a total of about 0.1˚C of warming by 2050,
half of it to date and the other half over the next three decades.
Should aviation’s pre-COVID growth resume, the industry will contribute a
6-17% share to the remaining 0.3-0.8˚C to not exceed 1.5-2˚C of global warming.
Under this scenario, the reduction due to COVID-19 to date is small and is projected
to only delay aviation’s warming contribution by about 5 years. But the leveraging
impact of growth also represents an opportunity: Aviation’s contribution to further
warming would be immediately halted by either a sustained annual 2.5% decrease in
flights under the existing fuel mix, or a transition to a 90% carbon-neutral fuel
mix by 2050.**
