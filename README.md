Aviation is on track to cause 0.1˚C of warming by 2050, despite a slowdown due to
COVID-19. An annual 2% decrease in flights or a highly ambitious 90% carbon-neutral 
fuel mix by 2050 will immediately prevent further contribution to global warming.

Data can be found in [`/data`](https://github.com/milankl/FlyingClimate/tree/main/data) and the main analyis and plotting notebook is [`/scripts/aviation_warming.ipynb`](https://github.com/milankl/FlyingClimate/blob/main/scripts/aviation_warming.ipynb).
