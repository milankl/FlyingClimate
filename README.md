### Abstract

Growth in aviation contributes more to global warming than is generally appreciated because
of the mix of climate pollutants it generates. Here, we model the CO2 and non-CO2 effects
like nitrogen oxide emissions and contrail formation to analyse aviation’s total warming footprint.
Aviation contributed approximately 4% to observed human-induced global warming to date, despite
being responsible for only 2.4% of global annual emissions of CO2. Aviation is projected to cause
a total of about 0.1˚C of warming by 2050, half of it to date and the other half over the next
three decades, should aviation’s pre-COVID growth resume. The industry would then contribute a
6-17% share to the remaining 0.3-0.8˚C to not exceed 1.5-2˚C of global warming. Under this scenario,
the reduction due to COVID-19 to date is small and is projected to only delay aviation’s warming
contribution by about 5 years. But the leveraging impact of growth also represents an opportunity:
Aviation’s contribution to further warming would be immediately halted by either a sustained annual
2.5% decrease in air traffic under the existing fuel mix, or a transition to a 90% carbon-neutral
fuel mix by 2050.
