Growth in aviation contributes more to global warming than is generally
appreciated because of the mix of climate pollutants it generates:
aviation contributed 6% to observed human-induced global warming since 1990,
despite being responsible for only 2% of global emissions as conventionally measured.
Should this growth resume, aviation is on track to have caused a total of
0.1˚C of warming by 2050, despite a reduction due to COVID-19. But the
1.leveraging impact of growth also represents an opportunity: under the
2.existing fuel mix, aviation’s contribution to further warming would be
3.immediately halted by either a sustained annual 2% decrease in flights
4.or a transition to a 90% carbon-neutral fuel mix by 2050.
